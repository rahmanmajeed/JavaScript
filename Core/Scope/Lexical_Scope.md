# Lexical Scope
We have seen the meaning of the two words in plain English.
With that knowledge, let's define **Lexical Scope** in plain English:

>**Lexical Scope** simply means that the **region** in which a **word** exists is determined by where it was **defined** or **created**.

Other definitions would be:

> **Lexical Scope** means that the meaning/value of a word can only be determined by the **region/environment** where it was created.

> **Lexical Scope** means that you don't directly outsource the meaning of a word to people from an outside **region** that uses the word. This is because lexical places emphasis on the origin on where it was **created/defined**.

Okay, i'll give an example.
Let's use the word: **"Dance"**.
The word "dance" was created/defined in Britain. The British people know its meaning. This word exists in the scope in which it was created: "Britain". Wales is in Britain so Wales has access to this word (remember we already explained why above). So the Welsh people can update the meaning of this word to suit their local dialect. This is because they are inside the scope of Britain.

The Germans cannot directly come and change the meaning of this word. This is because the word was not created in Germany. So, if the Germans wanted to use the English word: **"dance"** and that word has not yet been created by Britain, that word would not be available no matter how hard they try. This would make no one to know the actual meaning of that word in Germany because the word doesn't exist in the **British Lexicon**. (Don't worry if this seems gibberish, i'll explain with code later on)

Since we're students of Science and not Linguists, let's replace "word" with "variable".

Our new definition would be:

> **Lexical Scope** simply means that the **region** in which a **variable** exists is determined by where it was **defined** or **created**.
>
> **Lexical Scope** means that the meaning/value of a variable can only be determined by the region/environment where it was created.
>
> **Lexical Scope** means that you don't directly outsource the meaning of a variable to code from an outside region(block) that uses the variable. This is because lexical places emphasis on the origin on where the variable was created/defined.
