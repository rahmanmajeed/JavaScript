# Brief History of JavaScript

Javascript is defined as a _"high-level, interpreted scripting language"_ that conforms to the EcmaScript specification and maintained by **TC39**. JS was created in 15 by **Brendan Eich** while he worked in a scripting language to Netscape browser. Javascirpt was exclusively created to fulfill _Marc Andreessen's_ idea of having a **"glue languaage"** between HTML and web designers, which should be easy to use to assemble components such as images and plugins, in such way that the code would be directly written in the web page markup.

**Brendan Eich** was recruited to implement Scheme language into Netscape, but, due to a partnership between _Sun Microsystems_ and _Netscape_ in order to include Java in the Netscape navigator, his focus was switched into creating a language that was somehow Java-like with a similar syntax. In order to defend the idea of JavaScript against other proposals, Eich wrote, in 10 days, a working prototype.

The **ECMA** specification came a year later when Netscape submitted the JavaScript language to _ECMA_ International in order to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at _Netscape_. This led to the first _ECMA-262_ standard in **1997**. _ECMAScript-3_ was released in December **1999** and it is the modern-day baseline for JavaScript language. ECMAScript 4 was idle because Microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper JavaScript in IE, even though they had no competing proposals and had a partial, but divergent, implementation of the .NET language server-side.

In 2005, the open-source and developer communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with JavaScript. First, in 2005, Jesse James Garrett published the draft of what would be called AJAX, this resulted in the renaissance of JavaScript usage led by open source libraries like jQuery, Prototype, and MooTools. In 2008, after this whole community started using JS again, the ECMAScript 5 was announced and launched in 2009.
